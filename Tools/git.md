[worktree](https://fev.al/posts/git-worktree/ )

Gives you a simple command to check out a branch in a whole different directory, so for example you can fix a bug and deploy main while halfway through unsaved changes on a feature branch in another folder

Used like `git worktree add ../my_second_worktree the_other_branch`.
