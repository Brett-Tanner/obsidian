# Practical Vim

- `<>` denotes combinations of keys to be pressed together.
- `{}` indicates a list of valid keystrokes to follow the preceding command
- `-` indicates keys to be pressed together

## Commands

- `@:` repeats the last command
- `:s/target/replacement` replaces the next instance of `target` with `replacement` and is repeatable with `&` (but only on the current line)

## Copying

- `:reg` (or for me, just hitting backtick) shows you all registers and their contents
- `Y` copies to the end of the current line

### Registers

Delete, yank and change all go to the unnamed register (`""`). Yanks also go to the yank register (`"0`) at the same time.

Addressing a register with a lowercase letter overwrites it, while an uppercase letter appends to the register.

Sending anything to the black hole register (`"_`) discards it completely.

- `"{register}{motion}` lets you delete/yank/change to or put from a register

## Deleting

- `daw` uses a text object to delete the entire word the cursor is in and its whitespace; while `caw` does the same and drops you into insert mode
- `db` deletes from cursor to word start; `dw` from cursor to word end
- `S` deletes to the end of a line from the cursor

## Dot Command

Repeats the last change. But what is a 'change'?

Everything from when you enter insert mode to when you exit it is a single change, unless you interrupt the action by moving around with the arrow keys. Each time you press an arrow key it creates a new undo chunk.

Using motions which drop you into insert mode like `A` or `dw` includes them in the change, making them replay-able along with any changes you make in insert mode.

Generally the pattern you want to aim for is one key to move, then one key to execute.

## Formatting

- `>{num lines}` increases indentation one step from the current position for the number of lines given by the next input
- `gc{motion}` comments the lines covered by `motion`. `gcc` comments the current line and `gc` in visual mode comments the selected lines
- `gu{motion}` or `gU{motion}` downcase or up case the selection covered by `motion`
- `O` adds the newline above the current line rather than below. Useful for avoiding `ko`

## Lists

### Change List

Let's you jump through the history of changes for the current buffer

- `:changes` shows the change list
- `g;` goes back, `g,` goes forward
- The `backtick.` mark always stores the last change as well
- `gi` takes you to the last insertion and switches to insert mode

### Jump List

- `:jumps` shows the jump list, which is kept per tab
- `Ctrl-o` jumps back, while `Ctrl-i` jumps forward

## LSP

- `]d` and `[d` go to the next and previous diagnostics respectively
- `K` in normal mode brings up the definition of whatever's under the cursor

## Macros

You can execute macros in parallel on a selection with `:normal @q`. This means if there's a line in the middle which the macro would usually fail on, that failure won't prevent the macro acting on valid lines after it.

If you record a macro using `qq` and realise you need to append something to it (like moving to the next line) you can append to it with `qQ`.

Since macros are just saved into a register, if you want to edit them you can put them into a buffer from that register, then yank the macro back in once edited. When yanking it back into a register, be sure not to yank the whole line so you don't get trailing newline characters in your macro.

Golden rule is 'when recording a macro, ensure every command is repeatable'.

- Start by normalizing the cursor position
- Macros fail if any of their motions do, consider this a feature rather than a bug
  - Lets you do something like `100@q` if your motion is targeted enough
- Macros can also capture find & dot commands, so repeating something like `;.` is valid

- `@@` invokes the most recently invoked macro

## Modes

### Insert Mode

- `Ctrl-r{register}` pastes at the cursor in insert mode
- `Ctrl-v{code}` allows you to insert an arbitrary character by code (ASCII) or `Ctrl-vu{code}` for unicode
  - `ga` gives you the code for the character under your cursor
- `Ctrl-k{char1}{char2}` inserts the digraph made by the two chars. For example `Ctrl-k>>` would produce Â»

### Visual Mode

Repeating actions taken in visual mode with the dot command repeats them on a selection of the same length as the initial one.

Visual block mode is triggered with `ctrl-v`, and works much the same but in columns rather than lines

## Motions

- `,` reverts an `f{char}` search, while `;` repeats it
  - `%` jumps to the end of the next matching parentheses, then toggles between ends of them
  - `t{char}` is a variant of `f{char}` which stops before `{char}` rather than on it. Remember it as `t` like 'till'.
- `gj` & `gk` move down/up one 'display' line, motions like `$` and `^` can also be prefixed with `g` to do the same
- `Ctrl-a` increments the number under the cursor or the next number on the line, while `Ctrl-x` decrements it.
  - Both can prefixed with a number to increment/decrement that many times
- `m{char}` sets a mark at the cursor position to `{char}`. You can then use `backtick{char}` to jump to that mark, or `'{char}` for the start if the line.
  - lowercase chars as marks are limited to the file they're created in, while uppercase chars are global
  - if you use an uppercase `{char}`, it persists through sessions so can always be used to jump to that file

## Operators

Can all be combined with a motion to specify the range they apply to.

- `c` change
- `d` delete
- `y` yank to register
- `gc` comments
- `g~` swap case
- `gu` make lowercase
- `gU` make uppercase
- `<` indent left or `>` right
- `!` filter through an external program

## Search

- `*` searches for the word under the cursor and can be incremented/decremented like `/`
- `?` Is a backward search, inverse of `/`, still `n` for next occurrence, `N` for previous occurrence
- `f{char}` searches the line for the next instance of `{char}`, `;` for next occurrence, `,` for previous occurrence, `F{char}` searches backwards
- `c` appended to a `:%s` search will ask you for confirmation before making each change

## Settings

- `hlsearch` toggles search match highlighting
  - In my config it's turned on, and you can hit `esc` in normal mode to dismiss it

## Selection

- `gv` reselects the previous selection
- `o` toggles the 'free end' of the selection
- `vit` selects within tags

## Text Objects

- `v/d/ca` acts around the text object, replacing `i` doew the same within it
- `a{surround_char}` gives a text object around the nearest instances of `{surround_char}`, while `i{surround_char}` gives the same but inside the `{surround_char}` pair.
  - `t` selects around and within tags
  - works with paired brackets, quotes, etc. Not with random letters.
  - works when outside the specified text object, by jumping to the nearest one
- `w` & `b` move forward/backward to the start of the next/previous word, while `e` and `ge` do the same to the end
  - `s` acts on a sentence, `p` for paragraphs
  - Their capitalized variants move to the start/end of the next/previous WORD, skipping over slashes/hyphens etc.
  - WORD motions also work with change and delete motions
