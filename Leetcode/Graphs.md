# [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/)

## First Attempt

- Brute force approach is to just check all 4 sides of each node
  - Iterate through grid, checking if left, right, above and below are water (or an edge in this case)
  - I am very dumb
  - Didn't read the question properly
  - An island can be multiple lands connected together, as long as they're surrounded by water
  - So I typed a whole bunch of completely useless code
  - Read the damn question properly
